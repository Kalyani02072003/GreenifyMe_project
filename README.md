# GreenifyMe_project
A website to select saplings that are suitable for your room.  Also contains blogs sections where you can read other people's views on keeping a plant as most most people don't have much time to maintain a garden themselves.  This might not very helpful in reducing global warming and stuff but my aim was to create something that help people select their favorite plants for their house or room  and this might change their living styles.  being near to nature is always loved by everyone however due to busy schedule and routine not everyone can maintain a garden all by themselves.
